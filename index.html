      <p>
        I am Junyi Yu, and I am Chinese. When I think of the word ‘origin’ I will be thinking about the place that makes me want to become an artist, or what makes me want to be one. When I migrated to the United States, the first city I stayed in
        was New York, there was street art everywhere. Then I moved to San Francisco. There is so much outdoor art, for example, Hearts in San Francisco and great landscapes, for example, the Golden Gate Bridge view. None above are the main origin I
        want to start with. My origin started 2 years ago, with my self-built computer that has an RTX 2080 graphics card. That let me have so many great experiences with the virtual world. So I can visit “Los Santos”, to be a legal criminal, visit
        San Francisco by hacking the whole network system without myself walking in the street, and time travel back to world war two to be a fearless soldier. In virtual reality, you can be anyone you can’t be in real life. In my project, I will
        present reality with the digital world, massing with the human sensor between real and unreal. For visual angles, I will use all of them, from a first-person perspective to an overall still camera view. I will film landscapes, human emotion,
        virtual interaction with reality. I can’t wait to explore that new journey into the art world with digital video. Also, I can't wait to learn more skills when I am on this path of the journey. That is how I create “SF In Google Map”, and this
        project I will continue this kind of art in my future career.
